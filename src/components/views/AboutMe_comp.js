            <p>I am Courtney LeFevre and I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I have been married to my husband, Matthew, for two years. We have a beautiful daughter, Madelyn, who is a little over a year old. We currently live in Rexburg, Idaho and my husband and I are full-time students at Brigham Young University- Idaho. I am majoring in Marriage and Family Studies, and Matthew is studying Web Design and Development.</p>
            <p>My parents were divorced when I was in high school, and it has changed me in a lot of ways. Iâ€™ve decided I have a story to tell and I wanted to share it through this blog. I hope my story can help inspire you and give you the strength to keep enduring this life.</p>
